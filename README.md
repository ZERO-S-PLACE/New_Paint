# NEW PAINT

IT IS ONLY A STARTED PROJECT, containing simple raster and vector shape drawing features, with basic functions. (Cltr+c to close vector polyline, Cltr+s to switch drawing mode, also layer management is implemented)
These functions were further developed in the Bouncing Ball project (https://github.com/ZERO-S-PLACE/Bouncing_Ball), specifically in the Level Creator part.
